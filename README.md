# blockchain-procurement
This POC imagines a world of procurement where all participants in the supply chain are interconnected via a distributed, decentralised database which enables trust, visibility and transparency across all the transactions on the network.

We are using Multichain 2.0 APIs to insert the data into the blockchain.
